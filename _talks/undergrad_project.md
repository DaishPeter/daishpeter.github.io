I successfully defended my Bachelors in Science (First Class Honours) in Software Engineering with my thesis project: SmarTTband.

SmarTTband applied a data-centric approach to shot classification in the fast-paced sport of Table Tennis.

For this project, I designed a data collection pipeline and performed acceleration-based signal-segmentation to curate a clean dataset of four of the basic shot movements in table tennis: Forehand Topspin, Forehand Backspin, Backhand Topspin, Backhand Backspin.

After the data was curated, I developed a novel CNN classification network capable of automatically classifying table tennis shots based off the acceleration of a bluetooth accelerometer attached to the playing arm.
